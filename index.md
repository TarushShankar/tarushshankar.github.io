## 💼 Experience

### Research Assistant — Data Analysis & Machine Learning  
**COMBiN Research Lab, University of Alberta**  
*June 2024 – Present*  
- Developed a Multilayer Perceptron Regressor (MLP) model for predicting solar panel generation, achieving an R² of 0.84.  
- Processed, cleaned, and feature engineered over 1.1M time-series records to improve data quality and model suitability.  
- Led efforts to anonymize sensitive datasets, ensuring compliance with privacy regulations while reducing turnaround time.  

### Research Assistant — Software Developer & Field Data Collection  
**CityScan Technologies, University of Alberta**  
*June 2024 – Dec 2024*  
- Developed a hardware command-line application to control GoPro video recordings, optimizing storage by 10%.  
- Collected and processed LiDAR, GNSS, and IMU data over 50+ km of roads for infrastructure assessment.  
- Enhanced IMU data tracking scripts with human-readable output, preventing data loss and redundant collection.  

### Research Assistant — Data Analysis & Machine Learning  
**University of Alberta**  
*May 2023 – Aug 2023*  
- Conducted research on machine learning approaches for detecting Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy.  
- Achieved 78.89% accuracy and 0.74 F1-score with a Random Forest classifier on medical datasets.  
- Delivered a proof-of-concept ML algorithm incorporating feature engineering and standardized preprocessing techniques.

## 🖥️ Projects

### [FOODEGY — Android Meal Planner](https://github.com/CMPUT301F22T26/Foodegy)  
Java, Firebase, XML, Agile Methodologies  
- Developed and implemented the front end and back end of a Firebase-coupled Meal Planner (in a team of 6) using an iterative Scrum methodology on Android Studio with Java.  
- Allowed users to add recipes to meal planners; utilizing that information, the app compiles a shopping list by comparing it to the existing inventory.  
- Used the test-driven development methodology to create over 10+ reusable unit tests in Robotium integrated with GitHub Actions to assure quality and detect defects.  

### [MRI Motion Actuator](https://www.capstonedepot.live/post/5)  
3D Printing, Kanban, Report Writing, Presentations  
- Collaborated in a team of four to develop a motion actuator device that provides controlled vibrational frequencies to assist MRI-based detection of early-stage Intervertebral Disc (IVD) degeneration.  
- Delivered a minimum viable MRI-compatible actuator prototype with 3D-printed eccentric mass and housing.  
- Co-authored a detailed report outlining system design, implementation, and results.  
- Presented the final design at the Capstone Presentation Event to stakeholders and attendees.  
- A recording of the presentation is available on the [official capstone project page](https://www.capstonedepot.live/post/5) for further reference.
