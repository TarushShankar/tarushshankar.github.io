## 💼 Experience

### Research Assistant — Data Analysis & Machine Learning  
**COMBiN Research Lab, University of Alberta**  
*June 2024 – Present*  
- Developed a multilayer perceptron regressor for solar panel generation prediction, achieving an R² of 0.84.  
- Cleaned and engineered features from over 1.1M time-series records, improving model performance and memory efficiency.  
- Led efforts to anonymize sensitive datasets, ensuring compliance with privacy regulations while reducing turnaround time.  

### Research Assistant — Software Developer & Field Data Collection  
**CityScan Technologies, University of Alberta**  
*June 2024 – Dec 2024*  
- Designed and implemented a command-line application to control GoPro cameras, reducing storage usage by 10%.  
- Collected and processed LiDAR, GNSS, and IMU data across 50+ km of road infrastructure.  
- Improved IMU tracking scripts to prevent data loss and eliminate redundant collection.  

### Research Assistant — Data Analysis & Machine Learning  
**University of Alberta**  
*May 2023 – Aug 2023*  
- Conducted research on applying machine learning for early detection of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy.  
- Achieved 78.89% accuracy and 0.74 F1-score using a Random Forest classifier on preprocessed medical datasets.  
- Developed a proof-of-concept ML algorithm by engineering domain-specific features and implementing standardized preprocessing.
